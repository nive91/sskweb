The history of SSK goes way back to 1982 when Mrs. Mitu Alur, mother of
autistic child Malini, sowed the seed for existing SSK on the land which was
provided to us by Government of Karnataka. Since then, this great tree of
multiple services, interventions and programmes has grown. This beautiful
banyan tree with its columns of aerial roots give support to thousands of
children with neuromuscular impairment and developmental disabilities. Today we
are serving 1300 children annually in our various subcenters and affiliated
centers.

The nurturing of the seed to a beautiful banyan tree has happened due to the
enduring services with involvement and affection by professionals, parents and
volunteers and community and efforts of children themselves.  Till date we have
serviced around 20,000 children and families.
