designed to meet the individual needs of the children and families who seek our care.

Programs at the Unit
--------------------

Cater to children from pre-school until Senior Secondary / PUC

The Unit is recognized by education boards - CBSE, ICSE, IGCSE etc. to provide
concessions and accommodations for children with Specific Learning difficulties.

*Psycho Educational Screening, Assessment* –– The assessments measure a child's cognitive and
academic strengths and weaknesses.  Generally children are referred for these assessments when they
are having difficulties at school, or they are doing very well at school but have social emotional
difficulties and may be getting bored or children from integrated schools and with behavioural and
learning difficulties  who need to be given guidance for future educational / vocational placements.

*Psychological Evaluations* - to determine the child’s intellectual potential for both curriculum accommodations
(from various boards such as CBSE, ICSE, IGCSE etc) and modification as well as evaluating emotional issues.

The aim is to provide a thorough assessment which takes into account information from a number of sources
and considers different possibilities for difficulties.  We aim to make recommendations that will assist
children and their families to do the best they can do and also support the teacher in the classroom.

Based on the analysis and educational assessment results further diagnosis
and intervention is recommended for children with learning disorders.
