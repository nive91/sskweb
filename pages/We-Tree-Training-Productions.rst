Trainees work with mediums such as paper, jute and textile, wood, clay and paints.  The catering and training sections offer a variety of cookies, cakes, chocolates, savouries and sweets, snacks and lunches which are fresh and free of preservatives.

These products make perfect gifts for events, corporate and for personal needs. 

We at SSK invite you to step right in into a world of textures and designs, shapes and colours, sounds, smells, taste, lovingly crafted by the busy hands of our trainees and lovingly shaped by their instructors.
